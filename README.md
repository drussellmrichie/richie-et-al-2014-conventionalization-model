Yang, Richie, and Coppola (2014, topiCS)
=============================

This is a Python reimplementation of the agent-based model of lexicon conventionalization in our 2014 paper. The paper can be found here:

The model uses the NetworkX package to situate the agents on a social network. It is thus easy to extend the model to any network structure afforded by NetworkX
